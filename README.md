# Next.js (React) app using Pokemon API

Pokemon API is taken from personal github gist (modified a bit [Pokeapi extracted data](https://gist.github.com/saninmersion/f2999d482ba4c64f97b5156cd3681e7c). Details about pokemons are used from [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/).

Simple Next.js application for SSR where 100 Pokemons (in those 100 their transformations are included) are presented on the homepage. Each pokemon can be clicked on and details about each can be seen.
